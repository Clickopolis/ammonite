## API

### `Amount`

Amount is a class that Ammonite uses to control metrics. Its constructor takes a `List` of an item that has the same subset of properties as `Metric` (see [Metric](#Metric) for more information).

| Property       | Type                   |
|----------------|------------------------|
| `load`           | List<T extends Metric> |
| `treatAsInteger` | boolean                |

- `load` is the list
- `treatAsInteger` will round the value after each evaluation

### `Metric`

Metric is an interface that is F-bounded to `Amount`.

| Property | Type   |
|----------|--------|
| `total`    | number |
| `time`     | number |

All generic types of `Amount` must extend from `Metric`. This is easy to do with `extends`.

```Typescript
interface Click extends Metric {
    doubleClick?: boolean;
}
```
